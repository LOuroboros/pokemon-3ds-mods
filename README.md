# About this repository

Like the description of the repository says, I made it to gather whatever super small mods I end up doing as I test out stuff led by my endeavors developing stuff for the [Pokeemerald-expansion battle_engine](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/tree/battle_engine).

Don't expect anything at all.

Summary:

* `000400000011C400/romfs/a/0/1/3`: Changes the wild encounters of Pok√©mon Omega Ruby's Route 101 with Rayquaza.
  * Reason: I needed to test out some behaviors of the Air Lock ability.

Files terminated in "`_og`" are clean copies made to quickly restore things out.

## Usage

The quickest way is to load them through Citra.

Drop the `000400000011C400` folder into `Citra\user\load\mods`, boot up the game, and you're ready to go.
